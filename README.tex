\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

There has been much research on mode shift since the origins of applied transport planning and modelling in the 1950s (Boyce and Williams 2015; Aguiléra and Grébert 2014). Within this broad field of research, uptake of `active modes' (walking and cycling) has become a recent focus (Götschi et al. 2017). A range of methods have been used to understand and model walking and cycling levels, with `getting people cycling' being the topic of numerous papers during the 2010 (e.g. Beecham, Wood, and Bowerman 2012; Grisé and El-Geneidy 2018; Larsen, Patterson, and El-Geneidy 2013; Raffler, Brezina, and Emberger 2019; Zhang, Magalhaes, and Wang 2014).

Recent policy interest has been shown in planning active transportation networks for specific destinations, such as schools and major employers.
Encouraging active travel is not just about network infrastructure but complete package of policies, promotion, education, incentives, facilities at destinations (Forsyth and Krizek 2011; Handy, van Wee, and Kroesen 2014; McCormack and Shiell 2011; Pucher et al. 2010).
Within this context the specific-destination approach allows for more focused management of the `complete package' as relevant to that destination.
However as modellers we are also keen to ensure that specific-destination approaches do not neglect integration with the wider network (Forsyth and Krizek 2011).
It is difficult, in planning practice, to create calibrated models of walking and cycling behaviour, for the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Models of active modes of transportation are underdeveloped compared to vehicular models
\item
  The small scale of trips makes them sensitive to small scale features of the network. These can include: minor streets (often excluded from vehicle models altogether yet essential for active models); a greater variety of origin/destination points (not only zone centroids or a limited set of representative points within each zone, as with vehicular models); features such as cycle lane, sidewalk and footpath locations and condition, route attractiveness (as measured by e.g.~green vegetation) and street lighting, none of which are reliably mapped.
\item
  The case of cycling suffers from an additional challenge, in that current levels of uptake are low. It is reasonable to assume that as uptake increases, cultural and safety-in-numbers effects may create significant nonlinearity in the response of cycling mode share to cycling infrastructure, as has already happened in e.g.~Holland and Denmark, yet we lack the data to calibrate this (Hollander 2016).
\item
  Reliable, recent local data on mode choice and flows is often not available.
\item
  Finally, the funds invested in construction of active transportation networks --- and hence also in their modelling --- are low compared to typical spending on vehicular networks and their models.
\end{enumerate}

These challenges notwithstanding, two broad approaches to modelling cycling uptake have been particularly prominent in the literature.
The \emph{origin-destination approach} relies on estimates of current travel behaviour, represented in origin-destination datasets reporting the number of trips, e.g.~by mode of travel to work on a typical working day between residential zone origins and workplace destinations. This approach was used in the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), which was originally developed to support strategic cycle network planning based on commuter data for England (Lovelace et al. 2017). The `PCT approach,' which is a particular implementation of the `origin-destination' approach that models cycling uptake in terms of `distance-hilliness decay' functions (which can include other explanatory variables such as traffic levels) has subsequently been adapted to explore cycling potential in other contexts, including cycling uptake in US cities with low cycling levels (Ahmad et al. 2020) and the potential for mode shift to cycling for the `school commute' in across all state schools in England, with publicly available visualisations down to the street level (Goodman et al. 2019).

An alternative approach is to use the topology of the transport network as the basis of modelling using spatial network analysis (SNA) techniques (Chan and Cooper 2019; C. H. V. Cooper 2018; J. Cooper and Leahy 2017).
Within the context of the above challenges, this paper introduces an automated toolchain to assist in production of planning aids for active transportation focused on specific destinations but also highlighting integration with the wider network.
The approach of automation keeps the expense of deployment realistic for active transportation budgets. Given the challenges of reliable prediction of walking and cycling mode choice and flows, the aim at this stage is not to produce calibrated predictions, but to visualize likely walking and cycling behaviours within settlements in a manner useful to the planning process.
We do so using reproducible methods and open access input data to encourage others to employ the techniques in other areas to support evidence-based interventions to enable cycling uptake and as a basis for future research and development.

\section{Study area and input data}\label{study-area-and-input-data}}

The case study area is the local authority district of Monmouthshire, in rural South Wales (Figure \ref{fig:case}). The research took place in the context of the Welsh Active Travel Act (Welsh Government 2020).

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Case study area, with the parishes of Chepstow and Abergavenny highlighted in red.}\label{fig:case}
\end{figure}

The main destinations of interest were schools and leisure centres.
These can be obtained from OpenStreetMap with the tags (key-value pairs) \texttt{amenity=school} and \texttt{leisure=sports\_centre}.

Other than destinations of interest, the other key input was the boundary of the region responsible for the transport system in the local area.

A key input is origin-destination (OD) data.
OD data can be obtained from a number of sources, the most reliable being a list of geocoded addresses or postcodes associated with people who visit each destination regularly.
In cases where OD datasets derived from from surveys or official/commercial records are missing, they can be simulated using a range of techniques.
For the purposes of this paper, to enable full reproducibility, we simulate origins by sampling from buildings in the study area, as illustrated below.

\end{figure}

The other key input, for spatial network analysis, is route network data.
This can be obtained from OpenStreetMap, which has global coverage (although quality varies).
