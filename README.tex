\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

There has been much research on mode shift since the origins of applied transport planning and modelling in the 1950s (Boyce and Williams 2015; Aguil'era and Gr'ebert 2014). Within this broad field of research, uptake of `active modes' (walking and cycling) has become a recent focus (GÃ¶tschi et al. 2017). A range of methods have been used to understand and model walking and cycling levels, with `getting people cycling' being the topic of numerous papers during the 2010 (e.g. Beecham, Wood, and Bowerman 2012; Gris'e and El-Geneidy 2018; Larsen, Patterson, and El-Geneidy 2013; Raffler, Brezina, and Emberger 2019; Zhang, Magalhaes, and Wang 2014).

Within the wide range of approaches used to model cycling uptake, two broad approaches have been particularly prominent in the literature. The \emph{origin-destination approach} relies on estimates of current travel behaviour, represented in origin-destination datasets reporting the number of trips, e.g.~by mode of travel to work on a typical working day between residential zone origins and workplace destinations. This approach was used in the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), which was originally developed to support strategic cycle network planning based on commuter data for England (Lovelace et al. 2017). The `PCT approach,' which is a particular implementation of the `origin-destination' approach that models cycling uptake in terms of `distance-hilliness decay' functions (which can include other explanatory variables such as traffic levels) has subsequently been adapted to explore cycling potential in other contexts, including cycling uptake in US cities with low cycling levels (Ahmad et al. 2020) and the potential for mode shift to cycling for the `school commute' in across all state schools in England, with publicly available visualisations down to the street level (Goodman et al. 2019).

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relative merits of the `origin-destination approach' implemented in the PCT and the `spatial network' approach implemented in the open source sDNA software (Chan and Cooper 2019).
We do so using reproducible methods and open access input data to encourage others to employ the techniques in other areas to support evidence-based interventions to enable cycling uptake and as a basis for future research and development.

\section{Study area and input data}\label{study-area-and-input-data}}

The case study area is the local authority district of Monmouthshire, in rural South Wales (Figure \ref{fig:case}). The research took place in the context of the Welsh Active Travel Act (Welsh Government 2020).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=9.33in]{README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1} \caption{Case study area, with the parishes of Chepstow and Abergavenny highlighted in red.}\label{fig:case}
\end{figure}

The main destinations of interest were schools and leisure centres.
These can be obtained from OpenStreetMap with the tags (key-value pairs) \texttt{amenity=school} and \texttt{leisure=sports\_centre}.

Other than destinations of interest, the other key input was the boundary of the region responsible for the transport system in the local area.
We tested two approaches to define the `area of interest' defining the area within which routes were calculated: a simple buffer and a three-stage buffering process, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:buffers}.
The simple buffer approach involved creating polygon with borders a fixed distance (5 km in the first instance) around the destination (in this case the parishes of Chepstown and Abergavenny).
Model run times (and visualisation load times in interactive maps) depend on the amount of data served, creating an incentive reduce the size of the input data, and from a policy perspective, it makes sense to focus on the area over which local planners have control (and budget).
In this context, the three-stage process was developed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a buffer around the zone of interest with a threshold distance (set to 5 km)
\item
  Create a separate buffer around the region of interest to allow for some (more limited) inter-regional flow (set to 2 km)
\item
  Calculate the intersection between the two buffers outlined in the previous stages
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/buffers-1} \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/buffers-2} \caption{Illustration of the simple buffer and three stage buffering approaches to identify areas of interest within which travel to destinations in the zones could take place. The D represents the desination of interest.}\label{fig:buffers}
\end{figure}

A key input is origin-destination (OD) data.
OD data can be obtained from a number of sources, the most reliable being a list of geocoded addresses or postcodes associated with people who visit each destination regularly.
In cases where OD datasets derived from from surveys or official/commercial records are missing, they can be simulated using a range of techniques.
For the purposes of this paper, to enable full reproducibility, we simulate origins by sampling from buildings in the study area, as illustrated below.

\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-11}Origin-destination data, represented as `desire lines' emanating from residential origins with the destination fixed to the destination.}
\end{figure}

The other key input, for spatial network analysis, is route network data.
This can be obtained from OpenStreetMap, which has global coverage (although quality varies).
