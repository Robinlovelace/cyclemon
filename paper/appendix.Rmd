The automation workflow is coordinated using makefiles, a build system which automatically determines which outputs need to be updated at any point, thus avoiding unnecessary repetition of computationally expensive models. (We recommend remake [@Bernstein_2011] over the well known GNU Make [@Free_Software_Foundation_2020a] due to enhanced debugging ability, but the project makefile can be interpreted by either). 
Although makefiles are widely understood, we found ourselves limited by the fact that each target can match at most one pattern; in future implementations we would consider choosing an alternative system for declarative workflow management. 

For data analysis and modelling we used R and Python.

Data analysis and geographic operations required for the Propensity to Cycle Tool used the packages `sf`, `stplanr`, and `osmdata` for geographic processing, routing and OSM data access, respectively [@lovelace_stplanr_2018; @padgham_osmdata_2017; @pebesma_simple_2018]
The SpNA approach, on the other hand, made use of the 'Python stack', including `GeoPandas`, `shapely` and `pyrosm` [@gillies_shapely_2007; @jordahl_geopandas_2020; @tenkanen_pyrosm_2020].

Network data is downloaded from OpenStreetMap based on a user-provided buffer polygon for the model area, using pyrosm [@tenkanen_pyrosm_2020].
A network processing step was scripted using QGIS [@qgisdevelopmentteam_qgis_2019] to snap downloaded pedestrian crossing points to the relevant nodes due to a bug in pyrosm; however we anticipate this will be resolved in the near future, removing the need for this step.
To allow greater flexibility we define our own rules (in the script `osm_download.py`) for walking and cycling access to each network link.
We erred on the side of permissiveness in cases where OSM tagging data was ambiguous.
We also define here a 'cyclist deterrence' field based on the OSM highway classification tag; this is a dummy motorized annual average daily traffic flow (measured in vehicles per hour) representative of each road class as defined in @chan_using_2019, and is later used to determine the multipliers shown in table XX above.

The function `v.clean` from the GRASS GIS software [@neteler_open_2008] to break OSM polylines where they share nodes, thus converting the downloaded network to routable form complying with an endpoint connectivity rule.
sDNA Prepare is used to remove isolated systems and pseudonodes except where they are required to preserve different access, deterrence or splitting rules for subsections of links [@cooper_sdna_2020]; this greatly reduces the link count and hence computational load.

Metadata is automatically generated in HTML and json format alongside modelling outputs, based on the `view-metadata-template.jsontemplate` file. This in turn is processed by the `create-qgis-project-from-metadata.py` script; output from the latter forms a useful starting point for users of the data to produce their own custom maps. Summary maps are created by  `create-qgis-cycle-summary.py` and `create-qgis-walk-summary.py`.
