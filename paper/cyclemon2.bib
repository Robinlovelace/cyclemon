This paper proposes a new approach for measuring and valuing the barrier effect of different types of roads and for integrating the values into the appraisal of transport projects. This approach was developed based on the results of a survey of residents in areas around busy roads in two English cities. A series of stated preference exercises elicited preferences regarding crossing roads with specified design and traffic characteristics in locations with or without designated crossing facilities and making trade-offs with walking time and benefits or costs. The exercises were customised to represent different trip purposes (work, shopping, or leisure). Results were scaled with those obtained from a revealed preference exercise among some of the same participants, who indicated on a map their usual walking routes to locations that required them to cross the road. The results of the models of the participants’ choices were then used to develop an index of the size of the barrier effect caused by the different characteristics of roads (number of lanes, presence/width of central reservation (median strip), traffic density, and traffic speed) and pedestrian crossing facilities (type, waiting time, and walking time to access them). The index was also related with the estimated willingness to pay to reduce the barrier effect for existing trips, and with the number of new walking trips that could be generated with that reduction.}, journal={Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice}, author={Anciaes, Paulo and Jones, Peter}, year={2020}, month={Apr}, pages={227–250} }

This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.}, number={3}, journal={Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment}, author={Cervero, Robert and Kockelman, Kara}, year={1997}, month={Sep}, pages={199–219} }

Simulating bicycle mode share and flows can help decide where to build new infrastructure for maximum impact, though modelling budgets are limited. The four step model used for vehicles is not typically used for this task as, aside from the expense of use, it is designed around too-large zone sizes and a simplified network. Alternative approaches are based on aggregate statistics or spatial network analysis, the latter being necessary to create a model sufficiently sensitive to infrastructure location, although still requiring considerable modelling effort due to the need to simulate motor vehicle flows in order to account for the effect of motorized traffic in disincentivising cycling. The model presented uses an existing spatial network analysis methodology on an unsimplified network, but simplifies the analysis by substituting explicit prediction of motorized traffic flow with an alternative based on road classification. The method offers a large reduction in modelling effort, but nonetheless gives model correlation with actual cycling flows (R2 = 0.85) broadly comparable to a previous model with motorized traffic fully simulated (R2 = 0.78).}, number={11}, journal={Scientific Reports}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Chan, Eric Yin Cheung and Cooper, Crispin H.

There is currently a need for link-level, city wide modelling of cycling, both to ensure the needs of existing cyclists are catered for in planning, and to model the effects of changing infrastructure in shaping cyclist behaviour. Existing SpNA models treat cyclists and car drivers as if they make navigational decisions in a similar way, which in reality is not the case.This paper presents an SpNA model using hybrid betweenness, which fits cyclist flows in Cardiff, Wales using distance, angular distance, motor vehicle traffic and slope as predictors of route choice. SpNA betweenness is also shown to implicitly capture the effect of urban density on mode choice. As it handles route finding decisions of drivers and cyclists separately, the model presented is also applicable to road safety models examining the interaction between the two classes of road user. The model has low cost of data collection and is reproducible using publicly available network analysis software and open mapping data.

It computes measures of accessibility (reach, mean distance/closeness centrality, gravity), flows (bidirectional betweenness centrality) and efficiency (circuity) as well as convex hull properties, localised within lower- and upper-bounded radial bands. Weighting is flexible and can make use of geometric properties, data attached to links, zones, matrices or combinations of the above. Motivated by a desire to base network analysis on route choice and spatial cognition, the definition of distance can be network-Euclidean, angular, a mixture of both, custom, or specific to cyclists (avoiding slope and motorised traffic). In addition to statistics on network links, the following outputs can be computed: geodesics, network buffers, accessibility maps, convex hulls, flow bundles and skim matrices. Further tools assist with network preparation and calibration of network models to observed data. To date, sDNA has been used mainly for urban network analysis both by academics and city planners/engineers, for tasks including prediction of pedestrian, cyclist, vehicle and metro flows and mode choice; also quantification of the built environment for epidemiology and urban planning & design.}, journal={SoftwareX}, author={Cooper, C.

We present longitudinal evaluation of a model of the effect of urban environmental layout change in a city centre (Cardiff 2007–2010), on pedestrian flows. Our model can be classed as regression based direct demand using Multiple Hybrid Spatial Design Network Analysis (MH-sDNA) assignment, which bridges the gap between direct demand models, facility-based activity estimation and spatial network analysis (which can also be conceived as a pedestrian route assignment based direct demand model). Multiple theoretical flows are computed based on retail floor area: everywhere to shops, shop to shop, railway stations to shops and parking to shops. Route assignment, in contrast to the usual approach of shortest path only, is based on a hybrid of shortest path and least directional change (most direct) with a degree of randomization. The calibration process determines a suitable balance of theoretical flows to best match observed pedestrian flows, using generalized cross-validation to prevent overfit. Validation shows that the model successfully predicts the effect of layout change on flows of up to approx. 8000 pedestrians per hour based on counts spanning a 1 km2 city centre, calibrated on 2007 data and validated to 2010 and 2011. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a pedestrian flow model with assignment has been evaluated for its ability to forecast the effect of urban layout changes over time.}, journal={Transportation}, author={Cooper, C.

Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior.}, number={2 Suppl}, journal={American Journal of Preventive Medicine}, author={Handy, Susan L. and Boarnet, Marlon G. and Ewing, Reid and Killingsworth, Richard E.}, year={2002}, month={Aug}, pages={64–73} }

This suggests that topological and geometric complexity are critically involved in how people navigate urban grids. This has caused difficulties with orthodox urban modelling, since it has always been assumed that insofar as spatial factors play a role in navigation, it will be on the basis of metric distance. In spite of much experimental evidence from cognitive science that geometric and topological factors are involved in navigation, and that metric distance is unlikely to be the best criterion for navigational choices, the matter has not been convincingly resolved since no method has existed for extracting cognitive information from aggregate flows. Within the space syntax literature it has also remained unclear how far the correlations that are found with syntactic variables at the level of aggregate flows are due to cognitive factors operating at the level of individual movers, or they are simply mathematically probable network effects, that is emergent statistical effects from the structure of line networks, independent of the psychology of navigational choices. Here we suggest how both problems can be resolved, by showing three things: first, how cognitive inferences can be made from aggregate urban flow data and distinguished from network effects; second by showing that urban movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, are shaped far more by the geometrical and topological properties of the grid than by its metric properties; and third by demonstrating that the influence of these factors on movement is a cognitive, not network, effect.}, booktitle={Spatial Information Theory}, publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg}, author={Hillier, Bill and Iida, Shinichi}, editor={Cohn, Anthony G. and Mark, David M.}, year={2005}, pages={475–490}, collection={Lecture Notes in Computer Science} }

To elaborate on this discussion and to analyze the connection between street layout and walking using sophisticated methods, we attempt to capture the links and surrounding network features of urban street patterns. To this end, we employ the following four elements: closeness, betweenness, severance, and efficiency. Our empirical study examines street network configurations via a multi-scale network radius. The results show that locations with closer destinations and areas where people pass more frequently throughout a given network are associated with higher walking volume. Furthermore, a greater resemblance between straight-line and path distances from origins to destinations tend to encourage walking mobility. A longer convex hull, with a maximum radius that covers a wider shape and structure of links, is the most favorable setting for walking within a radius of up to 500m. We confirm that a higher convex hull-shape index reveals more deviation from the circularity of a street network’s convex hull. This negatively affects walking within a radius of 1–2km. We conclude that link and network radius-based attributes of street formations have significant effects on the spatial variations of walking within multi-scale walkable neighborhoods.

Despite the investment in cycling infrastructure, there has been little understanding of cycling activity patterns in general and the effect of spatial configuration on cycling route choices. This research aims at measuring the impact of cycling infrastructure and spatial configuration on aggregate cyclist movement over two time periods. To do so, this paper presents a spatial-based cyclist movement statistical model that regress cyclist movement flows with measure of spatial configuration, safety and infrastructure and urban character attributes. Using Elephant and Castle, a Central London location, as a case study, the authors analyze cycling movement data sets from 2003 and 2012 to compare the change in cycling behaviour and the impact that the Cycling Superhighway 07, introduced in 2011, has had on cycling patterns. Findings confirm the growth of cycling in London with a 1000% increase in cyclists along some routes in comparison to a 10% increase in population at the same time. More importantly, results also suggest that higher cyclist movement were observed along routes with greater convenience and continuity—over and above route segregation from vehicular traffic. The relationship between spatial configuration and aggregate cyclists movement is consistent between 2003 and 2012 where spatial configuration have remained the same while changes were observed in both modal split and cycling infrastructure. This result is in line with previous research wherein aggregate higher cyclists movement are observed on major routes offering direct connections than less direct routes. From a spatial cognition perspective, this research enriches our understanding on how the external built environment as measured by the spatial configuration measure relates to aggregated cyclists movement overtime and in identifying key potential factors in influencing cyclist wayfinding. Further research is needed into validating the results and examining this relationship at an individual basis on route choice. These results help us better understand the trade off between cycling safety and cycling legibility which could help inform cycling route design in the future.}, number={3}, journal={Behavioral Sciences}, author={Law, Stephen and Sakr, Fernanda Lima and Martinez, Max}, year={2014}, month={Aug}, pages={278–300} }

Appleyard and Lintell’s seminal study of residents of three urban streets in San Francisco found an inverse relationship between traffic and social contacts. The extent of social networks predicts unhealthy behaviors, poor health, and mortality; high rather than low social integration is associated with reduced mortality, with an effect size of similar magnitude to stopping smoking. Although community severance diminishes social contacts, the implications of community severance for morbidity and mortality have not been empirically established. Based on a systematic literature search, we discuss what is actually known about community severance. There is empirical evidence that traffic speed and volume reduces physical activity, social contacts, children’s play, and access to goods and services. However, no studies have investigated mental or physical health outcomes in relation to community severance. While not designed specifically to do so, recent developments in road design may also ameliorate community severance.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of urban health: bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine}, author={Mindell, Jennifer S and Karlsen, Saffron}, year={2012}, month={Apr}, pages={232–246} }

 @inproceedings{Raford_Chiaradia_Gil_2007, place={Washington, DC}, title={Space Syntax: The Role of Urban Form in Cyclist Route Choice in Central London}, url={http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8qz8m4fz}, abstractNote={This paper presents a new method for forecasting cyclist volume and route choice based on space syntax techniques for urban analysis. Space syntax has been shown to correlate strongly with pedestrian and vehicular trips in a number of international studies, but little research to date has focused on the role of urban form and street network design in cyclist route choice. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the distribution of cycling trips in the central London area, focusing on a sample of work-based commuting trips. A sample of 423 cyclists from 50 organizations was combined with cordon volume counts at several Central London locations. It was found that individual cycle trips were subject to a wide range of variables that made individual traces difficult to predict, but that total cyclist volumes corresponded strongly with the most accessible, direct streets in the urban network. This research suggests that angular minimization is an important factor in cyclist route choice and that measurement of least angle routes in urban environments can be a useful way of predicting cyclist volumes and route choice. Such techniques have the potential to save planners and policymakers the expense of performing origin destination studies and may offer a useful tool for cyclist volume prediction.}, booktitle={TRB (Transportation Research Record) 86th Annual Meeting Compendium of Papers CD-ROM}, publisher={Transportation Research Board}, author={Raford, N. and Chiaradia, Alain and Gil, J.}, year={2007}, pages={07–2738} }

However, there are few objective assessments of the configuration and quality of walking environments of the station approaching routes in high density built environments. This problem is acute in many developing countries and in China in particular. Twenty-Five Chinese cities have built up 87 urban rail transit lines during last 6 years. These developments have not been generally accompanied by integration of walking environments with the transit stations. In this paper, we develop a 67-item urban rail walking access scan tool to measure the walking environments of access routes to urban rail transit. We explain and justify an original instrumental design and conduct reliability tests. We apply it to stations located in different urban contexts of a medium-high density city of Nanchang, China. Most items demonstrate substantial to perfect level of inter-rater reliability (Kappa or ICC>0.6; the testing was on 174 station-approaching road segments), and above moderate intra-rater reliability (Kappa or ICC>0.4; the testing was on 90 segments). Micro-scale environmental data of 756 train-station approaching streets are collected. We offer the instrument as a reliable, practical and easy-to-use tool for urban planner and designer in high density environments to understand and re-engineer the urban design around new transit stations as a means of facilitating the adoption of transit as a preferred active mode of travel.}, journal={Journal of Transport & Health}, author={Sun, Guibo and Webster, Chris and Chiaradia, Alain}, year={2017}, month={Mar}, pages={191–207} }
