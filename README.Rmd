# Introduction

There has been much research on mode shift since the origins of applied transport planning and modelling in the 1950s [@boyce_forecasting_2015; @aguilera_passenger_2014]. Within this broad field of research, uptake of 'active modes' (walking and cycling) has become a recent focus [@gotschi_comprehensive_2017]. A range of methods have been used to understand and model walking and cycling levels, with 'getting people cycling' being the topic of numerous papers during the 2010 [e.g. @beecham_visual_2012; @grise_if_2018; @larsen_build_2013; @raffler_cycling_2019; @zhang_prioritizing_2014].

Within the wide range of approaches used to model cycling uptake, two broad approaches have been particularly prominent in the literature. The *origin-destination approach* relies on estimates of current travel behaviour, represented in origin-destination datasets reporting the number of trips, e.g. by mode of travel to work on a typical working day between residential zone origins and workplace destinations. This approach was used in the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), which was originally developed to support strategic cycle network planning based on commuter data for England [@lovelace_propensity_2017]. The 'PCT approach', which is a particular implementation of the 'origin-destination' approach that models cycling uptake in terms of 'distance-hilliness decay' functions (which can include other explanatory variables such as traffic levels) has subsequently been adapted to explore cycling potential in other contexts, including cycling uptake in US cities with low cycling levels [@ahmad_comparison_2020] and the potential for mode shift to cycling for the 'school commute' in across all state schools in England, with publicly available visualisations down to the street level [@goodman_scenarios_2019].

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relative merits of the 'origin-destination approach' implemented in the PCT and the 'spatial network' approach implemented in the open source sDNA software [@chan_using_2019].
We do so using reproducible methods and open access input data to encourage others to employ the techniques in other areas to support evidence-based interventions to enable cycling uptake and as a basis for future research and development.

# Study area and input data

```{r}
uklads = ukboundaries::lad2018
# View(uklads %>% st_drop_geometry())
monmouthshire = uklads %>% filter(lau118nm == "Monmouthshire")
```


The case study area is the local authority district of Monmouthshire, in rural South Wales (Figure \@ref(fig:case)). The research took place in the context of the Welsh Active Travel Act [@welshgovernment_active_2020].

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("robinlovelace/ukboundaries")
```

```{r case, fig.cap="Case study area, with the parishes of Chepstow and Abergavenny highlighted in red."}
knitr::include_graphics("README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png")
```

The main destinations of interest were schools and leisure centres.
These can be obtained from OpenStreetMap with the tags (key-value pairs) `amenity=school` and `leisure=sports_centre`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# run code once to get schools data
library(osmdata)
osm_schools = opq(sf::st_bbox(monmouthshire)) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "school") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
osm_leisure = opq(sf::st_bbox(monmouthshire)) %>% 
  # add_osm_feature(key = "leisure", value = "sports_centre") %>% # few responses
  add_osm_feature(key = "leisure") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()

saveRDS(osm_schools, "osm_schools_list_monmouthshire.Rds")
saveRDS(osm_leisure, "osm_leisure_list_monmouthshire.Rds")
```

```{r}
osm_schools = readRDS("osm_schools_list_monmouthshire.Rds")
osm_leisure = readRDS("osm_leisure_list_monmouthshire.Rds")
osm_schools_poly = osm_schools$osm_polygons %>% 
  select(osm_id, name)
osm_leisure_poly = osm_leisure$osm_polygons %>% 
  select(osm_id, name)
# mapview::mapview(osm_leisure_poly)
# mapview::mapview(osm_schools_poly)
chepstow_comp = osm_schools_poly %>% 
  filter(str_detect(string = name, pattern = "Chepstow Comp")) 
```

Other than destinations of interest, the other key input was the boundary of the region responsible for the transport system in the local area.
We tested two approaches to define the 'area of interest' defining the area within which routes were calculated: a simple buffer and a three-stage buffering process, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:buffers).
The simple buffer approach involved creating polygon with borders a fixed distance (5 km in the first instance) around the destination (in this case the parishes of Chepstown and Abergavenny).
Model run times (and visualisation load times in interactive maps) depend on the amount of data served, creating an incentive reduce the size of the input data, and from a policy perspective, it makes sense to focus on the area over which local planners have control (and budget).
In this context, the three-stage process was developed as follows:

1. Create a buffer around the zone of interest with a threshold distance (set to 5 km)
2. Create a separate buffer around the region of interest to allow for some (more limited) inter-regional flow (set to 2 km)
3. Calculate the intersection between the two buffers outlined in the previous stages

<!-- The advantages of the simple buffer approach included simplicity and minimisation of parameters that had to be hard-coded into the analysis.  -->
<!-- Taking both factors into account, we use the simple approach represented in the left hand plot of Figure \@ref(fig:buffers), saving the three stage approach for contexts where it is advantageous to model cross-region flow but also to reduce the proportion of trips modelled crossing regional/state boundaries. -->

<!-- This process is now available as a function, ... in the package stplanr. -->

A key input is origin-destination (OD) data.
OD data can be obtained from a number of sources, the most reliable being a list of geocoded addresses or postcodes associated with people who visit each destination regularly.
In cases where OD datasets derived from from surveys or official/commercial records are missing, they can be simulated using a range of techniques.
For the purposes of this paper, to enable full reproducibility, we simulate origins by sampling from buildings in the study area, as illustrated below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

  # filter(building == "residential") %>% # too few
  filter(str_detect(string = building, pattern = "resi|yes|house")) %>% # too few
  select(osm_id, name, building)

The other key input, for spatial network analysis, is route network data.
This can be obtained from OpenStreetMap, which has global coverage (although quality varies).
